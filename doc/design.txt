A scratchbook for ideas about the design of the system. Eventually should
become part of technical reference for that small project. We'll see how
it will pan out.

One of assumptions is that there can be more than a single apartment in the future.


First iteration

- there's an apartment that has a name
- apartment has availability schedule
- a simple reservation on basic contact details can be made (no payments
or any additional steps)

Considerations:

- calculated availability must be stored independently to avoid overhead
of querying schedule and reservations in multiple steps
- unique ID should be generated for every reservation for easy identification.
For now, it will be enough to rely on auto-incremented primary key
